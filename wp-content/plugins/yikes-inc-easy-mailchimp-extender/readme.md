Easy MailChimp Forms
===========
Easy MailChimp Forms allows you to painlessly add MailChimp signup forms to your WordPress site. You can add forms to posts or pages with shortcodes or to template files with PHP tags. Simply copy and paste your MailChimp API Key into the plugin admin settings and it will pull in all your MailChimp lists. From there you can choose the lists you want to make forms for. For a single list you can check off the fields you want to include on your form and order them via an easy drag-and-drop interface. This plugin adds plenty of CSS selectors to the form code allowing you to completely customize the look of your forms.

Frequently Asked Questions
===========

### Do I need to have a MailChimp Account? 
Yes, you can register for one for free at [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/signup/ "MailChimp Signup").

### Do I need to have lists already set up in MailChimp? 
Yes, you have to have at least 1 list set up in MailChimp. 

For more help, visit the MailChimp Support article [How do I create a new list?](http://kb.mailchimp.com/article/where-can-i-find-my-api-key "How do I create a new list?")

### What do I do first? 
The first step is to add your MailChimp API key. This will allow your site to communicate with your MailChimp account. This is done on the plugin "MailChimp Settings" page.

### Where do I find my API Key? 
From your MailChimp Dashboard, click on your account name in the upper left hand corner of the screen under the MailChimp logo to expose the "Account Settings" menu. Click on "Account Settings" to go to the Account Settings screen and the click on the "Extras" menu. Under "Extras" choose "API keys." From there you can create a new key if you do not already have one.

### How do I add my MailChimp lists? 
After you add your API key, the plugin will fetch all of your MailChimp list information and load it into the plugin admin. Go to the plugin "Manage List Forms" page to choose the lists you want to make forms for.

### How do I add the MailChimp signup forms to my site? 
You can use a shortcode to add a form to a page or post. For each list on the plugin "Manage List Forms" page you will see a shortcode at the top. Copy the shortcode and paste it into any post or page where you want a form to appear. For example, if my form had the shortcode [yks-mailchimp-list id="1234567891"] I would copy and paste that into the page or post I wanted to add that form to.

Alternatively, you can use the PHP snippet to add the form to a template file.

### Don't I have to enter a list ID for each list I want to add to my site? 
Not anymore! With the 2.0 version of the MailChimp API all list information can be imported with just the API key.

### My Information isn't showing up when people subscribe, what gives? 
You're likely using an old version of the plugin. Please update to the latest version and import your list data.

### My list data was changed/the form isn't showing up since the 2.0 update, what's up with that?
Due to the code overhaul required for new version features, the structure we were using to save data had to be completely changed over to conform to the MailChimp schema. The old unique IDs the plugin assigned to lists have been deprecated. The custom fields are now pulled in from the MailChimp servers. If your form isn't showing up with the shortcode, just copy and paste it again to fix this issue.
