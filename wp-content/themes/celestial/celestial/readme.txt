    Introduction to Celestial (Celestial Reloaded)
-------------------------------------------------------

(1) What's in the Download

When you unzip your download, you will find a few things to help you get setup.

   1. extras - this is a folder with extra things
   2. child-theme - this is where you will find a child theme for doing modifications
   3. celestial.zip - this is your actual theme that you install

(2)  Installing Your Theme
Installing Celestial will be just like any other theme by using the 
WordPress theme installer. You can also unzip the theme file and upload
the theme folder with its files into the /wp-content/themes/ folder.

(3) Making Theme Modificatons
WordPress recommends using a "child theme" whenever you want
to make theme modifications to core theme files. This allows you to get theme updates
whenever they come available without overwriting changes you might have made. This theme
includes a child theme in your original download in a folder called child-theme.
To read more about child themes, please check out the WordPress Codex:
http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes

(4) Theme Options
Celestial comes with the built-in WordPress Theme Customizer which lets
you make personalized changes to your theme layout, colours, and more.
To access the customizer, you can do it from the Dashboard main page
and clicking on the big button "Customize your Site", or from the 
Appearance >> Theme Options.

(5) Plugins (Optional)
When you look at the Celestial demo website http://demo.styledthemes.com/celestial/
you will find that there are some very nice things sliding, fading, and looking really
nice. These are plugins I am using in the demo, but they are plugins that I
included extra css styling for you, should you decide to install the optional plugins:

 (1) Widgetkit (free)
 (2) Contact Form 7 (free)
 (3) Dynamic Widgets (free)
 (4) Widget CSS Classes (free)
 (5) Simply Exclude (free)
 (6) Remove Widget Title (free)
 (7) Recent Posts Plus (free)
 (8) Breadcrumbs NavXT
 (9) WP Google Maps (free)
(10) LayerSlider (paid)
