*** Widgetkit Gallery ***

You have the option of using the image list layout to create a gallery, but with the added features of Widgetkit to give you a nice thumbnail overlay and popup lightbox for viewing images.

Remember that this theme is built on a 12-column grid layout. So you can decide how many columns to have in your gallery. I recommend creating your thumbnails  from the full sized image, and then uploading them to your Media Library. I also recommend making your thumbnails the same size for consistent layout.

If you want more than one row for your gallery, simply copy the code below to a new line in your editor text view. This sample snippet below gives you a 4 column/1 row gallery.

<div class="st_wkgallery">
<div class="row-fluid">
<ul class="thumbnails">
<li class="span3"><span class="st_wkgallery-tn"><a title="This is a Title of Image" href="path-to-your-full-size-image.jpg"><img alt="Lightbox Image" src="path-to-your-thumbnail-image.jpg" /></a></span></li>
<li class="span3"><span class="st_wkgallery-tn"><a title="This is a Title of Image" href="path-to-your-full-size-image.jpg"><img alt="Lightbox Image" src="path-to-your-thumbnail-image.jpg" /></a></span></li>
